No action submission endpoint — external agents can't submit actions mid-simulation\n2. No action queue/timeout mechanism — no way to wait for external input with timeout\n3. No pause mechanism in step loop — orchestrator runs synchronously, can't yield for external agents\n4. No observation API endpoint — agents can't fetch their observation between submissions\n5.

AWM provides 1,000 diverse, executable environments (e-commerce, project management, booking systems, etc.) backed by real SQLite databases with MCP tool-use interfaces. This would make task completion verifiable, proxy observables derivable from real tool traces, and adversarial behavior more realistic.\n\n## Design Sketch\n\n### Phase 1: AWM as task substrate\n- Add awm as optional dependency (extras_require)\n- Create swarm/env/awm_bridge.py adapter that:\n  - Wraps AWM environment servers as TaskProvider\n  - Maps AWM tool-call results → ProxyObservables (task_progress from DB state changes, verifier_rejections from AWM verification)\n  - Maps AWM binary verification → soft label p via calibrated confidence\n- Modify Orchestrator task flow to support external environment providers\n\n### Phase 2: MCP interface for LLMAgent\n- Let LLMAgent interact with AWM environments via MCP tool-calling\n- Replace Action.CLAIM_TASK / Action.SUBMIT_TASK with MCP tool sequences\n- Audit-log all tool calls for replay\n\n### Phase 3: Multi-agent over shared environments\n- Multiple agents interact with same AWM database (concurrent access)\n- Governance mechanisms apply to tool-call streams\n- Adversarial agents can attempt DB manipulation, social engineering via tool misuse\n\n## Key Concerns\n- AWM is single-agent episodic; we need multi-agent persistent state — bridge must handle this\n- AWM requires Python 3.12+; verify compatibility\n- AWM binary verification needs mapping to soft labels p in [0,1]\n- Heavy dependency (Azure/OpenAI for synthesis); pre-generated environments should be vendored or cached\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] AWM installed as optional dep, import guarded\n- [ ] At least one AWM environment usable as task substrate in a scenario\n- [ ] ProxyObservables derived from real tool-call traces\n- [ ] Existing tests still pass\n- [ ] Example scenario YAML demonstrating AWM-backed tasks","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-15T15:40:33.861045-05:00","created_by":"raelisavitt","updated_at":"2026-02-15T18:22:15.67785-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T18:22:15.67785-05:00","close_reason":"AWM Phase 1 complete: bridge package, AWMHandler, AWMAgent, MCP client, observable mapper, verifier bridge, scenario YAML, tests (56 passing).
