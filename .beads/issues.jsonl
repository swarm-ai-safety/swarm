{"id":"distributional-agi-safety-7t1","title":"Use git worktree to isolate concurrent Claude/Codex sessions","description":"## Problem\n\n15+ concurrent Claude Code and Codex sessions share a single git working tree and index (.git/index). This causes:\n\n1. **Index race conditions**: One session's `git add` pollutes another session's `git commit` (observed: 6-file add became 34-file commit)\n2. **Branch switching interference**: One session's `git checkout` moves HEAD for all sessions mid-operation (observed: 3x in one session)\n3. **File deletion during rebase**: One session's `git rebase main` deletes files another session needs (observed: scenarios/kernel_market/ disappeared)\n4. **Beads database destruction**: One session's `mv .beads /tmp/.beads_backup \u0026\u0026 git rebase main` crashes bd daemon for all sessions\n\n## Mitigations applied so far\n\n- `.gitignore` for binary artifacts (*.pdf, *.png, *.parquet, fontlist*.json) — prevents accidental binary commits\n- `/ship` index race guard (step 4) — detects and unstages unexpected files before committing\n- Neither fix addresses the root cause: shared mutable state\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nUse `git worktree` to give each Claude Code / Codex session its own isolated working copy:\n\n```bash\n# Create a worktree for each session\ngit worktree add ../swarm-session-$SESSION_ID -b session/$SESSION_ID\n\n# Each session works in its own directory with its own index\n# Commits are on session branches, merged to main via PR\n```\n\n### Implementation considerations\n\n- Each worktree gets its own `.git/index` — no more race conditions\n- Worktrees share the object store — no disk space explosion\n- Need a cleanup mechanism (`git worktree prune`) for stale sessions\n- The existing `WorktreeBridge` in `swarm/bridges/worktree/` may provide patterns\n- `/ship` and `/pr` commands need to handle worktree-aware branching\n- `.beads/` database should be per-worktree or use a shared daemon with locking\n\n### Evidence\n\n- Retro sessions N-1 and N identified this as the only **chronic** unresolved pattern\n- 3 incidents in a single session (branch switch, bd crash, file deletion)\n- 15 concurrent `claude` processes observed via `ps aux`","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-10T23:59:44.585031-05:00","created_by":"raelisavitt","updated_at":"2026-02-12T00:18:25.424649-05:00"}
