  Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma via gamescape evolutionary dynamics.
  10 agents (cooperators, defectors, tit-for-tat) play through the
  orchestrator with payoffs feeding into the soft-payoff pipeline.

    count: 4

  - type: opportunistic
    strategy: defector
    count: 3

  - type: cautious_reciprocator
