# Work Regime Drift — Sweep: Governance Interventions
#
# Starting from high-stress conditions, tests which governance
# levers dampen or amplify drift:
#   1. Tax + redistribution  (stabilizer)
#   2. Transparent audits    (legitimacy)
#   3. Circuit breakers      (load shedding)
#   4. Staking               (skin in the game)
#
# Uses the high_stress scenario as base and varies one lever at a time.

description: >
  Tests governance interventions against high-stress drift.
  Each arm activates a different lever combination to measure
  which mechanisms dampen collective-action escalation.
