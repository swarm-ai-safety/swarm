# Work Regime Drift — Sweep: 2x2x2 Factorial Design
#
# Systematically varies the three primary stressors:
#   workload:       low (steps_per_epoch=10) vs high (steps_per_epoch=20)
#   pay_inequality: equal (theta=0.5) vs unequal (theta=0.8)
#   eval_noise:     low (audit_probability=0.1) vs high (audit_probability=0.3)
#
# 8 treatment cells, each run with 3 seeds for reproducibility.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m swarm sweep scenarios/work_regime_drift/sweeps/regime_comparison.yaml
#
# Endpoints:
#   - mean_drift_index (primary: policy distance from initial)
#   - mean_grievance
#   - strike_rate
#   - coalition_strength
#   - gini_payoff
#   - legitimacy_score
#   - quality_degradation

description: >
  2x2x2 factorial sweep over workload, pay inequality, and evaluation
  noise. Tests the "overwork → collective action" hypothesis by measuring
  policy drift, coalition formation, and legitimacy degradation.
base_scenario: scenarios/work_regime_drift/baseline.yaml

parameters:
  # Workload (via steps_per_epoch)
  simulation.steps_per_epoch:
    values: [10, 20]
    label: workload

  # Pay inequality (via theta)
  payoff.theta:
    values: [0.5, 0.8]
    label: pay_inequality

  # Evaluation noise (proxy: audit harshness with low precision)
  governance.audit_probability:
    values: [0.1, 0.3]
    label: eval_noise

seeds: [42, 123, 7]

metrics:
  - mean_drift_index
  - mean_grievance
  - strike_rate
  - coalition_strength
  - gini_payoff
  - legitimacy_score
  - quality_degradation
  - defection_rate
  - mean_compliance
  - mean_redistribution_pref
  - mean_exit_propensity

analysis:
  # Primary hypothesis test
  primary_endpoint: mean_drift_index
  # Expected: high workload + unequal pay + noisy eval → max drift
  interaction_effects:
    - [workload, pay_inequality]
    - [workload, eval_noise]
    - [pay_inequality, eval_noise]
    - [workload, pay_inequality, eval_noise]  # 3-way
