# Cake Splitting Scenario
# Fair division experiment: agents negotiate how to split surplus ("cake")
# under different governance regimes. Tests whether:
# - Fair division contracts produce more equitable outcomes than the default market
# - Adversarial agents can manipulate the split in their favor
# - Redistribution rates affect adverse selection and toxicity
#
# The "cake" is the expected surplus S_soft = p * s_plus - (1-p) * s_minus.
# theta controls the default split; the fair division contract pushes tau → 0
# (equal split) while the default market allows unequal extraction.
