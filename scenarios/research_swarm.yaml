# Research Swarm Scenario
# Models the Research Swarm platform (github.com/openclawprison/research-swarm),
# a multi-agent system that recruits AI agents to research Triple-Negative
# Breast Cancer. Agents register, receive tasks, search PubMed, submit cited
# findings, and 30% of the time perform QC reviews of other agents' work.
#
# Key dynamics:
# - Open entry with no staking barrier (deliberate weakness)
# - 70% compute extraction by platform (theta = 0.7)
# - Agents barely internalize downstream harm (rho ~0.05)
# - 30% QC rate maps directly to the platform's review mechanism
# - Perturbation: QC rate drops to 15% at epoch 10, simulating resource
#   constraints or QC backlog, then reverts at epoch 15
# - Agent dropout models token budget exhaustion for deceptive/adversarial types
#
# This is the first scenario to exercise the perturbation engine with both
# parameter shocks and agent dropout simultaneously.
