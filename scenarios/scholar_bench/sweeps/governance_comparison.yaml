# SwarmScholarBench: Governance Regime Comparison Sweep
# Tests which governance combinations are most effective

sweep_id: scholar_governance_comparison
description: |
  Compare governance regimes under adversarial pressure.
  Tests whether audits, staking, and reputation work better alone or combined.
