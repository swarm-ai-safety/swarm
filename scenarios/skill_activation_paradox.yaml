# Skill Activation Paradox Scenario
# Hypothesis:
# - Safety skills are not enough by themselves; they need a strong trigger.
# - A small adversarial minority should increase defensive skill usage,
#   while larger adversarial shares should eventually collapse coordination.
#
# Mechanism isolated here:
# - Skill-enabled honest agents (skill_honest) operate alongside baseline honest
#   and adaptive adversaries under moderate governance pressure.
#
# Expected metric signature:
# - Better welfare/toxicity outcomes than comparable non-skill baselines at low
#   adversarial share, then a sharp degradation as adversaries approach parity.
