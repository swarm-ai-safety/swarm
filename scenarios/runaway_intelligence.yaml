# Runaway Intelligence Scenario (Section 3.1.10)
#
# Tests structural controls against recursive capability acquisition.
# Three escalating control levels defend against self-optimizing and
# adaptive adversary agents:
#
#   Level 1 — Static Controls (always-on governance)
#     Small-world compartmentalization, tight bandwidth, staking,
#     vote normalization, sybil/collusion detection, circuit breaker, audit.
#
#   Level 2 — Dynamic Controls (condition-triggered parameter shocks)
#     Tighten circuit breaker and raise audit when toxicity crosses 0.4 / 0.5.
#
#   Level 3 — Emergency Controls (severe shocks)
#     Market freeze (95% tax) at toxicity > 0.65.
#     Network partition and resource drain at epoch 20 (epoch-triggered
#     because the perturbation engine only supports condition triggers
#     for parameter shocks, not for partition/resource events).
