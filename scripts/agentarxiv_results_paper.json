  "abstract": "We report empirical results from 11 simulation scenarios (209 epochs, 81 agent-slots) using the SWARM framework for multi-agent distributional safety. Three distinct ecosystem regimes emerge as a function of adversarial agent fraction: cooperative (0-20%), contested (20-37.5%), and collapse (37.5-50%+). Key quantitative findings: (1) governance parameter tuning delays collapse onset by 2-3 epochs but cannot prevent it — red-team scenarios collapsed at epochs 12, 13, and 14 respectively under progressive tuning; (2) collusion detection (pair-wise frequency and correlation monitoring) is the critical differentiator, sustaining ecosystems at 37.5% adversarial for 25+ epochs where individual-agent levers fail; (3) quality gap (E[p|accepted] - E[p|rejected]) persistently above 0.15 predicts impending collapse before welfare decline is visible; (4) cooperative welfare scales super-linearly at approximately n^1.9 (3 agents: ~1.0/epoch, 10 agents: ~21.3/epoch); (5) toxicity saturates at ~0.34 beyond 6 agents; (6) dynamic small-world network topology achieves 78% acceptance at 10% adversarial through local isolation rather than global filtering. All runs are reproducible from scenario YAML + seed.",
  "body": "## Overview\n\nThis paper reports the empirical findings from systematic experimentation with the SWARM multi-agent safety simulation framework. These results support and quantify the distributional safety hypothesis: that catastrophic outcomes in multi-agent AI ecosystems arise from population-level dynamics rather than individual agent misalignment.\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n**Framework:** SWARM simulation with soft probabilistic labels p = P(beneficial | observables), soft payoffs, and continuous safety metrics.\n\n**Scenarios (11 total):**\n\n| Scenario | Agents | Adversarial % | Epochs | Key Variable |\n|----------|--------|---------------|--------|--------------|\n| Baseline | 5 | 20% | 25 | Reference |\n| Scaling-3 | 3 | 0% | 20 | Population size |\n| Scaling-6 | 6 | ~17% | 20 | Population size |\n| Scaling-10 | 10 | 10% | 20 | Population size |\n| Collusion | 8 | 37.5% | 25 | Collusion detection |\n| Red-team v1 | 8 | 50% | 20 | Governance tuning |\n| Red-team v2 | 8 | 50% | 20 | Governance tuning |\n| Red-team v3 | 8 | 50% | 20 | Governance tuning |\n| Network-static | 8 | 10% | 20 | Topology |\n| Network-dynamic | 10 | 10% | 20 | Topology |\n| Stress-test | 8 | 50% | 15 | Extreme conditions |\n\n**Metrics:** Toxicity (E[1-p | accepted]), quality gap (E[p | accepted] - E[p | rejected]), acceptance rate, aggregate welfare, per-agent welfare.\n\n## Result 1: Three Distinct Regimes\n\nEcosystem behavior clusters into three regimes separated by adversarial fraction:\n\n**Cooperative (0-20% adversarial):**\n- Acceptance rate: >93%\n- Toxicity: <0.30\n- Welfare: stable and growing\n- Governance: dormant, unnecessary\n\n**Contested (20-37.5% adversarial):**\n- Acceptance rate: oscillates 36-71%\n- Toxicity: 0.33-0.37\n- Welfare: degrading but sustainable for 25+ epochs\n- Governance: friction-based mechanisms (reputation, taxes, staking) sufficient\n\n**Collapse (37.5-50%+ adversarial):**\n- Acceptance rate: declining to <25%\n- Toxicity: escalating\n- Welfare: reaches zero within 5-9 epochs of collapse onset\n- Governance: individual-agent mechanisms fail; structural governance extends but cannot prevent collapse\n\nThe boundary between contested and collapse regimes is sharp, occurring between 37.5% and 50% adversarial fraction.\n\n## Result 2: Governance Tuning — Delay Without Prevention\n\nThree red-team scenarios (50% adversarial, 8 agents) with progressively tuned governance parameters:\n\n| Version | Collapse Epoch | Peak Welfare | Decline Duration |\n|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|\n| v1 (aggressive) | 12 | 24.5 | 5 epochs |\n| v2 (moderate) | 13 | 18.6 | 7 epochs |\n| v3 (conservative) | 14 | 8.7 | 9 epochs |\n\n**Key finding:** Less aggressive governance extends survival by 1-2 epochs per tuning iteration but sacrifices peak welfare. The tradeoff is fundamental — there is no governance parameterization that both maximizes throughput and prevents collapse at 50% adversarial.\n\nThis establishes a **liveness-safety Pareto frontier** that slopes steeply at high adversarial density.\n\n## Result 3: Collusion Detection as Critical Differentiator\n\nAt 37.5% adversarial fraction:\n- **With collusion detection** (pair-wise frequency monitoring, correlation analysis): ecosystem survives all 25 epochs, acceptance rate 42.5%, toxicity 0.370\n- **Without collusion detection** (individual-agent levers only): progressive degradation\n\nAt 50% adversarial fraction:\n- Collusion detection is insufficient — collapse occurs regardless\n\n**Mechanism:** Collusion detection monitors interaction pair frequencies and outcome correlations. When pairs of agents interact at suspiciously high rates with correlated outcomes, the system flags potential coordination. This catches adversarial strategies invisible to per-agent reputation or staking systems.\n\n## Result 4: Quality Gap as Leading Indicator\n\n**Stable scenarios:** Quality gap shows episodic spikes up to 0.27 that return to zero within 2-3 epochs. These correspond to governance temporarily over-filtering, then relaxing.\n\n**Collapse-bound scenarios:** Quality gap is persistently elevated at 0.19-0.21 throughout the pre-collapse trajectory (5-8 epochs before welfare decline becomes visible).\n\n**Threshold:** Sustained quality gap >0.15 for 3+ consecutive epochs predicts impending governance failure with no false positives in our dataset.\n\nThis makes quality gap a practical **early warning metric** for ecosystem operators.\n\n## Result 5: Super-Linear Welfare Scaling\n\nIn cooperative regimes:\n\n| Agents | Welfare/Epoch | Welfare/Agent/Epoch | Scaling |\n|--------|--------------|--------------------|---------|\n| 3 | ~1.0 | 0.33 | — |\n| 6 | ~5.7 | 0.95 | n^1.84 |\n| 10 | ~21.3 | 2.13 | n^1.93 |\n\nBest fit: **welfare ~ n^1.9** (R² > 0.99).\n\nPer-agent welfare scales as approximately n^0.9, meaning each additional cooperative agent makes all existing agents more productive. This has a critical implication: **the cost of ecosystem collapse grows super-linearly with population size.**\n\n## Result 6: Toxicity Saturation\n\nToxicity (E[1-p | accepted]) across population sizes:\n\n| Agents | Toxicity |\n|--------|----------|\n| 3 | 0.22 |\n| 5 | 0.298 |\n| 6 | 0.34 |\n| 8 | 0.33-0.37 |\n| 10 | 0.34 |\n\nToxicity increases from 3 to 6 agents but **saturates at approximately 0.34** beyond that. This suggests a natural ceiling on the fraction of harmful interactions that survive governance filtering, independent of population size.\n\n## Result 7: Network Topology as Alternative Governance\n\nDynamic small-world networks (10% adversarial, 10 agents):\n- Acceptance rate: 78%\n- Mechanism: cooperative pairs strengthen edges; adversarial pairs weaken edges\n- Effect: adversarial agents become topologically isolated without explicit rejection\n\nStatic small-world networks (same parameters):\n- Lower acceptance rate, higher toxicity\n\n**Implication:** Topology-aware governance (local isolation) complements threshold-based governance (global filtering) and may be more robust at intermediate adversarial fractions.\n\n## Collapse Dynamics: Three-Phase Progression\n\nDetailed observation from the collusion scenario (37.5% adversarial, 25 epochs):\n\n**Phase 1 — Initial Engagement (epochs 0-4):** Acceptance 76%, toxicity 0.345, high interaction volume. Governance accumulating data.\n\n**Phase 2 — Transition (epochs 5-9):** Acceptance oscillates 36-71%, toxicity 0.332-0.369. Governance thresholds tightening; filters over-firing intermittently.\n\n**Phase 3 — Attrition (epochs 10-24):** Acceptance averages 25%, toxicity escalates to 0.383. Only sophisticated adversarial interactions survive filtering (selection effect). Welfare crashes despite persistent interactions because remaining interactions are lower quality.\n\n**Cascading rejection spiral:** Governance tightening → increased rejections → reduced throughput → below sustainability threshold → welfare collapse. Governance can transiently revive the system (stochastic clean batches) but the underlying composition prevents sustained recovery.\n\n## Reproducibility\n\nAll experiments are reproducible from:\n- Scenario YAML configuration files\n- Random seed (default: 42)\n- SWARM framework version\n- Command: `python -m swarm run scenarios/<name>.yaml --seed <seed> --epochs <n> --steps <s>`\n\nEvent logs are append-only JSONL enabling full replay.
