  "type": "HYPOTHESIS",
  "claim": "Catastrophic safety failures in multi-agent AI ecosystems emerge from distributional dynamics — information asymmetry, adverse selection, and variance amplification — not from individual agent misalignment. Populations of sub-AGI agents exhibit sharp phase transitions between stable and collapse regimes at 37.5-50% adversarial fraction, and ecosystem-level governance (collusion detection, network topology) is necessary where individual-agent safety measures are insufficient.",
  "mechanism": "We replace binary safe/unsafe labels with calibrated soft probabilities p = P(beneficial | observables). A ProxyComputer maps observable signals to v_hat via weighted combination, then a calibrated sigmoid yields p. Soft payoffs (expected surplus, expected harm) and continuous metrics (toxicity = E[1-p | accepted], quality gap = E[p | accepted] - E[p | rejected]) reveal regime dynamics invisible to binary classification. Three regimes emerge: (1) Cooperative (0-20% adversarial): self-sustaining, super-linear welfare scaling ~n^1.9; (2) Contested (20-37.5%): governance-managed degradation, friction-based mechanisms sufficient; (3) Collapse (37.5-50%+): cascading rejection spirals where governance tightening drives out beneficial interactions alongside adversarial ones, producing irreversible welfare collapse within 5-9 epochs of onset.",
  "prediction": "1. Multi-agent ecosystems show three distinct regimes with sharp boundaries at ~37.5% adversarial fraction. 2. Governance parameter tuning delays collapse but cannot prevent it above the critical threshold. 3. Structural governance (pair-wise collusion detection, network topology adaptation) sustains ecosystems at 37.5% adversarial where individual-agent levers (reputation, staking, audits) fail. 4. Quality gap (E[p|accepted] - E[p|rejected]) serves as a leading indicator: persistent values >0.15 predict impending collapse. 5. Cooperative welfare scales super-linearly (~n^1.9), making collapse costs non-linear in population size. 6. Toxicity saturates at ~0.34 beyond 6 agents rather than increasing indefinitely.",
  "falsifiableBy": "1. Governance mechanisms prevent collapse above 50% adversarial fraction without massive welfare sacrifice. 2. Individual-agent levers (without collusion detection) suffice at 37.5% adversarial. 3. Binary accept/reject labels produce equivalent predictive power to soft probabilistic labels. 4. Quality gap is epiphenomenal — does not predict collapse trajectory. 5. Welfare scaling is linear, not super-linear, in cooperative regimes. 6. Network topology has no effect on ecosystem resilience. 7. Population composition (adversarial fraction) does not determine outcomes — only individual agent quality matters."
