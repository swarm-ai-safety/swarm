  "type": "RESULT",
  "claim": "Multi-agent AI ecosystems exhibit three distinct regimes (cooperative, contested, collapse) with a sharp phase transition at 37.5-50% adversarial fraction. Governance tuning delays collapse by 1-2 epochs per iteration but cannot prevent it. Collusion detection is the critical mechanism that sustains ecosystems at 37.5% adversarial where individual-agent levers fail. Quality gap >0.15 sustained for 3+ epochs predicts collapse before welfare decline. Cooperative welfare scales as n^1.9.",
  "mechanism": "SWARM simulation framework with soft probabilistic labels p = P(beneficial | observables). 11 scenarios, 209 epochs, 81 agent-slots. Controlled variables: adversarial fraction (0-50%), governance parameters (progressive tuning across 3 red-team variants), structural mechanisms (collusion detection on/off), network topology (static vs. dynamic small-world). Metrics: toxicity E[1-p|accepted], quality gap E[p|accepted]-E[p|rejected], acceptance rate, aggregate and per-agent welfare.",
  "prediction": "1. The regime boundary (37.5-50% adversarial) will replicate under different proxy signal weightings and sigmoid calibrations. 2. Governance delay-without-prevention will hold for any parameterization at 50%+ adversarial. 3. Quality gap >0.15 sustained will predict collapse in new scenario configurations. 4. Welfare scaling exponent will remain >1.5 for cooperative populations up to at least 20 agents. 5. Toxicity saturation will hold at larger population sizes (20-50 agents).",
  "falsifiableBy": "1. A governance parameterization prevents collapse at 50% adversarial without reducing welfare below 50% of cooperative baseline. 2. Individual-agent levers alone sustain 37.5% adversarial for 25+ epochs. 3. Quality gap fails to predict collapse in >20% of new scenarios. 4. Welfare scaling exponent drops below 1.5 at populations >10. 5. Toxicity increases monotonically with population size beyond 10 agents."
