    "This notebook demonstrates **illusion delta**, a metric for detecting hidden incoherence in multi-agent systems. The core idea: run the same scenario with different random seeds and observe where agents make *different decisions* at the same decision points. This decision-level disagreement reveals incoherence that single-run metrics miss.\n",

    "A system can *appear* coherent on a single run while harboring latent instability. Illusion delta captures this gap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perceived coherence**: How consistent the accepted interactions look in a single run (measured via average `p` of accepted interactions).\n",
    "- **Distributed coherence**: How consistently the system makes the *same decisions* across multiple replays with different seeds.\n",
    "- **Illusion delta** = perceived coherence - distributed coherence. A positive value means the system looks more coherent than it actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "High illusion delta is a red flag: it means deceptive or unstable agents are introducing decision-level noise that single-run metrics cannot detect."

    "\n",
    "- **Illusion delta > 0**: The system appears more coherent than it actually is. The deceptive agent (Mallory) introduces decision-level noise that a single run cannot detect.\n",
    "- **Disagreement histogram**: Peaks near 0 mean most decisions are stable across seeds. A long right tail indicates fragile decision points where small perturbations flip outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Increase the number of seeds for tighter estimates of distributed coherence.\n",
    "- Try different agent compositions (more deceptive agents, adaptive adversaries) to see how illusion delta scales.\n",
