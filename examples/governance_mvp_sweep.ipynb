    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to look for in the plots above:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Welfare (top-left):** Which mechanisms increase total ecosystem welfare above the baseline? The combined defense-in-depth (green) typically outperforms any single mechanism.\n",
    "- **Toxicity (top-right):** Lower is better. Mechanisms like circuit breakers and random audits directly target toxic interactions. Green bars indicate improvement over the baseline.\n",
    "- **Honest vs Adversarial advantage (bottom-left):** A ratio above 1.0 (green) means honest agents earn more than adversarial ones -- the system rewards good behavior. Ratios below 1.0 (red) indicate the mechanism fails to deter exploitation.\n",
    "- **Per-type payoffs (bottom-right):** The ideal governance mechanism increases honest payoffs while decreasing deceptive/adversarial payoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No single mechanism is sufficient.** Each lever addresses a different attack vector -- reputation gaming, bandwidth flooding, collusion, etc.\n",
    "2. **Defense-in-depth works best.** Combining multiple mechanisms provides broader coverage and makes it harder for adversaries to find a single exploit path.\n",
    "3. **Some mechanisms have trade-offs.** Transaction taxes reduce welfare for everyone (including honest agents). Circuit breakers can over-freeze in edge cases. Tuning matters.\n",
    "4. **Collusion detection is a critical differentiator.** In scenarios with coordinated adversaries, collusion detection is often the mechanism that prevents ecosystem collapse."
