"""Base class for environment handlers in the orchestration layer.

All handlers share a common pattern:
- Accept an ``event_bus: EventBus`` for append-only event logging
- Declare which ``ActionType`` values they own via ``handled_action_types``
- Dispatch agent actions via ``handle_action``
- Build per-agent observation fields via ``build_observation_fields``

The ``HandlerActionResult`` model provides a unified return type that
the orchestrator uses for proxy computation and interaction finalization.
