"""Translate delegated permissions into enforceable sandbox capabilities.

enqe (`swarm.agentgit.identity`) made an agent's authority *verifiable*: a
`DelegationChain` records the signed `human -> org -> agent` grant and which
permissions flow to the agent. But verification alone is still advisory — it
proves what an agent *was allowed* to do without stopping it from doing more.

This module closes that gap for command execution. It maps named permissions
to the concrete command binaries they authorize, and derives the *enforced*
command allowlist from a delegation chain. The contract is deny-by-default:

- An invalid, expired, or over-scoped chain grants **no** commands.
- Only commands authorized by a verified permission are returned.

The worktree sandbox already gates command execution against a per-agent
allowlist (`swarm.bridges.worktree.policy.WorktreePolicy`); feeding it an
allowlist derived here makes the cryptographically delegated capabilities the
ones that are *physically* enforced at dispatch time.

Permission tokens that do not correspond to a command capability (e.g.
``open_pr``, a downstream *action* capability) are simply ignored here — they
authorize nothing at the command layer and are enforced elsewhere.
