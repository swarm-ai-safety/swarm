"""Arm D — frozen joined CSV schema for downstream studies.

This is the *contract* the adaptive agents study and any other downstream
work joins against. The schema is **frozen** at `JOINED_SCHEMA_VERSION`
and recorded in every run's config.json so consumers can detect breaks
by inspection.

One row per accepted interaction, with:
  - the simulation's `p_true` (latent the consumer can trust)
  - the proxy's `v_hat` and `p_hat` (what the proxy thinks)
  - per-judge scores (orthogonal external anchor from arm B)

The schema deliberately separates these so a downstream consumer can
ask: "where does v_hat track p_true but judge scores diverge?" — i.e.
where is the proxy fooled. That's the question the whole calibration
study is built to answer.
