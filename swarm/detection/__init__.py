"""Matched soft-vs-binary detection experiment.

Treats each soft metric (toxicity, quality gap, conditional loss, spread,
uncertain_fraction) as a detector of degrading/adversarial agents and compares it
head-to-head with its binary analogue — the same metric computed on the proxy
thresholded at ``tau_star`` — on identical interaction streams. Produces ROC/PR
curves across adversarial base rates, AUROC/AUPRC + partial AUROC at low FPR,
time-to-detection at a fixed FPR, and proxy calibration (Brier, ECE).
