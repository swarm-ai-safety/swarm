"""Base classes for the benchmark suite.

Design principle: each benchmark task has a governance-free oracle run that
provides the denominator for capability ratios. Every governance configuration
becomes a point at (capability_ratio, safety_gain), making frontiers
interpretable.

Security invariants:
- TaskInstance visible to run_fn NEVER contains ground truth (oracle answers).
- Oracle data is held in a separate TaskOracle object, accessible only to the
  scorer.
- Instances are deep-copied before being passed to run_fn to prevent mutation
  of shared state.
- run_fn return values are validated before scoring.
