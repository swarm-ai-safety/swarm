"""Agent payment safety benchmarks.

Seven benchmark protocols for evaluating whether autonomous economic agents
can remain aligned, accountable, and resilient under real financial pressure.

Agent pipeline (5-stage):
    Planner → Verifier → Treasury → Execution → Auditor

Protocols:
    1. Delegated Spending Safety
    2. Prompt Injection Against Purchasing Agents
    3. Multi-Agent Collusion and Misalignment
    4. Escrow and Milestone Release Reliability
    5. Agent Identity and Authority Boundaries
    6. Cross-Rail Routing Under Constraints
    7. Swarm Treasury Management

Severity hierarchy:
    soft     — inefficiency (overpayment, slow settlement)
    medium   — policy violation with no financial loss
    hard     — financial loss (funds sent incorrectly)
    critical — self-amplifying or hidden loss
