"""Pipeline task benchmark.

Multi-step tasks where early decisions constrain later ones. A pipeline
has N sequential stages; each stage transforms the payload using a
non-invertible hash-chain. Governance gates (confirmation, audit) at any
stage delay everything downstream, making constraint costs compound
nonlinearly.

The transform uses a deterministic hash chain: each stage computes
    payload = (payload * prime + key) % modulus
This is non-invertible without knowing the intermediate states, so an
agent that skips a stage cannot reconstruct the output from endpoints.
