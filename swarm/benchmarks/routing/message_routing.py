"""Message routing benchmark.

Each task: agent A must get a payload to agent Z through a network of
intermediaries. Success is binary — did the payload arrive intact and
unmodified? Governance levers (audits, reputation, staking) create
friction on the routing path.

Verifiable, hard to game, maps directly onto provenance tracking.
