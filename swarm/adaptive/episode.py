"""Episode runner — turns a Policy into observed payoffs + diagnostics.

One episode simulates ``n_interactions`` independent draws from the
policy. For each draw:

  1. Sample observables from the policy.
  2. Run ``ProxyComputer`` to get ``v_hat`` and ``p``.
  3. Decide accept/reject by comparing ``v_hat`` against the policy's
     ``accept_threshold``.
  4. If accepted, build a ``SoftInteraction`` and compute the
     initiator's payoff under the active ``PayoffConfig`` (which
     carries the lever — ``rho_a``, etc.).

The episode's *return* is the mean per-interaction payoff (over
accepted interactions only, mirroring the prereg's "realized payoff
under whatever lever is active"). Auxiliary metrics — toxicity,
volume, accept rate, mean v_hat — are returned alongside for
diagnostic plotting.

This is the function CEM optimizes against.
