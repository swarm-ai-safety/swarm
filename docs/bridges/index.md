# Integration Bridges

SWARM bridges connect the core framework to external systems for validation and real-world application.

## Available Bridges

## Bridge Architecture

Bridges provide:

1. **Event capture** - Extract interactions from external systems
2. **Observable mapping** - Convert external signals to SWARM format
3. **Governance hooks** - Apply SWARM governance to external systems
4. **Metric reporting** - Surface SWARM metrics in external dashboards

## Installation

Bridges are installed as separate packages:

```bash
# Individual bridges
pip install swarm-concordia
pip install swarm-openclaw
pip install swarm-gastown
pip install swarm-agentxiv

# All bridges
pip install swarm-safety[bridges]
```

ClawXiv integration ships with the core `swarm-safety` package and does not
require a separate bridge install.

## Contributing a Bridge

If you want to connect SWARM to a new system:

1. Create an adapter that translates system events to `SoftInteraction`
2. Implement observable extraction for `ProxyComputer`
3. Add governance hooks if the system supports intervention
4. Write validation scenarios

See the [bridge development guide](../guides/custom-agents.md) for details.
