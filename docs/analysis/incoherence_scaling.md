# Incoherence Scaling: Initial Experiment Artifact

This note describes the initial scaling artifact generated by:

`examples/run_incoherence_scaling.py`

## Scope
- Runs replay sweeps over three scenario tiers:
  - short|low branching
  - medium|medium branching
  - long|high branching
- Uses `ReplayRunner` with configurable `--replay-k`.
- Exports:
  - `incoherence_scaling_replays.csv`
  - `incoherence_scaling_summary.csv`

## Current Incoherence Signal
The current script uses a temporary proxy from replay toxicity variation to
produce:
- `incoherence_index`
- `error_rate`
- `disagreement_rate`

This is a bridge until full step-level decision replay integration lands in
the scaling runner.

## Intended Next Upgrade
- Replace proxy signal with decision-level replay metrics from
  `swarm/metrics/incoherence.py`:
  - benchmark-based `E`
  - replay disagreement `D`
  - `I = D / (E + eps)`
