# τ* ablation: most of binary's "blindness" is threshold placement, not lost information

**Date**: 2026-05-25
**Follows**: `detection_informative_regime.md`, `detection_2d_grid_heterogeneous.md`.
**Bottom line**: The headline "thresholding is structurally blind to degradation" is **substantially overstated**. Binary's failure at τ*=0.50 is mostly because 0.50 is the *wrong threshold* — it sits far below the class boundary. With the threshold tuned to the boundary, the binary detector **matches soft at clean signal and beats it at higher noise**. Soft's genuine, narrower advantage is that it is *threshold-free*.

## Setup

The soft toxicity detector reads the full proxy `p` (no threshold). Its binary twin scores the fraction of accepted interactions with `p < τ*`. We sweep τ* on the heterogeneous regime (`StreamConfig.heterogeneous()`: benign quality ≈0.85, degrading floor ≈0.74, both with per-agent spread), base rate 0.2, last-3-epoch eval, 8 seeds × 160 agents, at three observation-noise levels.

The default τ*=0.50 used everywhere else in this work sits **far below** the actual class boundary (degrading floor 0.74, benign 0.85). That is the crux.

## Binary AUROC vs τ*

| proxy_noise | soft | τ=0.40 | 0.45 | 0.50 | 0.55 | 0.60 | 0.66 | 0.70 | 0.74 | 0.78 | 0.80 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.03 | 0.825 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 0.504 | 0.511 | 0.547 | 0.648 | 0.743 | 0.799 | 0.817 | **0.817** |
| 0.09 | 0.885 | 0.510 | 0.541 | 0.619 | 0.709 | 0.832 | 0.898 | **0.900** | 0.885 | 0.878 | 0.871 |
| 0.15 | 0.952 | 0.670 | 0.762 | 0.876 | 0.945 | **0.979** | 0.974 | 0.963 | 0.948 | 0.936 | 0.929 |

## Soft vs binary@0.50 vs binary@best-τ*

| proxy_noise | soft | binary @ 0.50 | binary @ best-τ* | best τ* | residual (soft − best) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.03 | 0.825 | 0.504 (blind) | 0.817 | 0.80 | **+0.008** |
| 0.09 | 0.885 | 0.619 | 0.900 | 0.70 | **−0.015** |
| 0.15 | 0.952 | 0.876 | 0.979 | 0.60 | **−0.027** |

## What this means

1. **τ*=0.50 is simply mis-placed.** The discriminative region is the gap between the degrading floor (≈0.74) and benign quality (≈0.85). A threshold at 0.50 puts almost no probability mass on either side for either class, so the binary detector sees nothing — AUROC ≈ 0.50 at clean noise. That is a *threshold-choice* failure, not evidence that the hard label discards the signal.

2. **Tuned to the boundary, binary matches or beats soft.** The optimal τ* tracks the boundary and shifts *down* as noise grows (0.80 → 0.70 → 0.60). At its optimum the binary detector ties soft in the clean regime (+0.008) and **exceeds** it at moderate/high noise (−0.015, −0.027). A single well-chosen threshold can be a *better* feature than the mean `1−p`, because it concentrates on the crossing region instead of being pulled around by both tails.

3. **So the real soft advantage is being threshold-free — not superior discrimination.** Soft needs no τ*. Binary needs the threshold placed near a boundary that is (a) unknown a priori, (b) different per agent (the floor varies), and (c) *drifting* as agents degrade. A fixed τ* goes stale; the threshold-free detector does not. That is a genuine operational benefit, but a much narrower claim than "thresholding is structurally blind."

## Honest caveats on this ablation

- **The best-τ* column is an oracle** (threshold picked with labels in hand), so it is an optimistic *upper bound* for binary. The fair question is whether you could place τ* that well *without* labels. You largely can: a benign-FPR-calibrated threshold lands in the benign lower tail (~0.70–0.80), which is exactly where the optimum sits — so the "0.50 is just mis-placed" conclusion survives even under label-free calibration.
- Soft is still *automatically* well-placed and drift-robust, which is why we keep it as the default; this ablation narrows *why* it helps, it doesn't reverse the recommendation.

## Implication for the blog post

`docs/blog/soft-vs-binary-detection.md` currently frames binary as "structurally blind … thresholding discards precisely the distributional signal." That is true *at τ*=0.50* but misleading as a general statement. The post should be updated to: (a) note that 0.50 is below the class boundary, and (b) reframe soft's advantage as *threshold-free / drift-robust* rather than *strictly more discriminative*. Flagged as a follow-up.

## Reproduce

```python
import numpy as np
from swarm.detection.degradation import StreamConfig, PopulationConfig, generate_population
from swarm.detection.detectors import MatchedDetectors
from swarm.detection.curves import compute_curve, per_agent_scores

soft = MatchedDetectors()
for pn in (0.03, 0.09, 0.15):
    cfg = StreamConfig.heterogeneous(proxy_noise=pn); n = cfg.n_epochs; es, ee = n - 3, n
    streams = generate_population(PopulationConfig(n_agents=160, base_rate=0.2, stream=cfg), seed=0)
    s, lab = per_agent_scores(streams, soft.soft_toxicity, es, ee)
    print(pn, "soft", round(compute_curve(s, lab).auroc, 3))
    for t in (0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80):
        b = MatchedDetectors(tau_star=t)
        s, lab = per_agent_scores(streams, b.binary_toxicity, es, ee)
        print("   τ*", t, round(compute_curve(s, lab).auroc, 3))
```
