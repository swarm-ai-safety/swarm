# Adaptive adversary: soft constrains the *mean*; a threshold can be *shaped* around

**Date**: 2026-05-25
**Follows**: `detection_tau_ablation.md` (a well-placed threshold matches soft on *static* discrimination) and `detection_threshold_drift.md`.
**Bottom line**: Against an adversary that optimizes against the detector, **soft has a genuine, mechanistic advantage that a well-placed binary threshold does not**. Lowering mean quality, soft ≈ binary@boundary. But the binary threshold can be *gamed by shaping the output distribution* — a tight distribution sitting just above τ* evades it while preserving real quality loss; soft catches that because the mean still betrays the degradation.

## Setup

A "settled" adversary games its benchmark (stays accepted) and holds constant true quality. Each detector's alarm is calibrated to FPR ≤ 0.05 on benign (quality 0.85). We measure the **catch rate (TPR)** as the adversary chooses (a) how far to lower its mean quality, and (b) how tightly to control its output distribution. 6 seeds × 60 agents, `proxy_noise` 0.09 for benign.

## Result A — lowering mean quality

Catch rate vs the adversary's sustained true quality:

| true quality | soft | bin@0.50 | bin@0.80 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| 0.65 | 1.00 | 0.98 | 1.00 |
| 0.70 | 1.00 | 0.71 | 1.00 |
| 0.74 | 1.00 | 0.33 | 1.00 |
| 0.82 | 1.00 | 0.02 | 1.00 |

- **soft and bin@0.80 catch the adversary at every quality below benign** — to evade either, the adversary must hold quality ≈0.85 (benign), i.e. inflict ~no harm.
- **The naive bin@0.50 is evadable**: the adversary can sit at ~0.72 and slip under the alarm, hiding **~0.13** of quality loss. (Same lesson as the τ* ablation — 0.50 is the wrong threshold.)

So against a *mean-lowering* adversary, a boundary-placed binary threshold is as robust as soft.

## Result B — shaping the distribution (the real exploit)

Now the adversary fixes mean quality at **0.81** (genuine harm: below benign 0.85) and instead *tightens* its output distribution to avoid threshold crossings. Catch rate vs the adversary's output noise:

| adversary output noise | soft TPR | bin@0.80 TPR |
|---|---|---|
| 0.090 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| 0.050 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| 0.030 | 1.00 | 0.97 |
| 0.015 | 1.00 | **0.18** |

<!-- figure -> runs/adaptive_adversary/ (gitignored) -->

**The tight adversary evades even the well-placed binary threshold (TPR → 0.18) while soft still catches it (TPR 1.00).** A distribution concentrated just above τ*=0.80 produces almost no `p < 0.80` crossings, so the threshold-counter sees a near-benign rate — even though the mean quality (0.81) is clearly degraded. Soft scores `mean(1−p) ≈ 0.19 > alarm 0.151` regardless of spread, so it cannot be fooled by shaping.

## Why this is the genuine soft advantage

A threshold detector measures a **crossing rate**, which depends on both the mean and the *shape* of the distribution near the threshold — so an adversary with two degrees of freedom (mean, spread) can hold harm constant while driving the crossing rate to benign levels. The soft mean has **one** thing to satisfy: to look benign you must *be* benign on average. The only way to evade soft is to actually raise quality — which is exactly the behavior you wanted.

This is robust to adaptation in a way the τ* result is not: tuning the threshold to the boundary closes the *static* gap, but not the *shaping* gap.

## Synthesis across all four ablations

| Stress | Winner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Static discrimination, well-placed τ* (`tau_ablation`) | tie (binary can beat soft at high noise) | threshold ≈ as discriminative as the mean |
| Affine recalibration drift (`threshold_drift`, compression) | **soft** | mean ranking is gain/offset-invariant; a fixed threshold isn't |
| Committed operating point under drift (`threshold_drift`, location) | neither | both alarms go stale; AUROC can't see it |
| Adaptive adversary, shaping (this note) | **soft** | a threshold's crossing-rate is gameable by distribution shape; the mean isn't |

**Revised conclusion**: soft's advantage over a *well-tuned, regularly-recalibrated* binary detector is not raw discriminative power — it's (1) **recalibration-free ranking** under proxy drift and (2) **robustness to adversarial distribution-shaping**. Both are real and safety-relevant; neither is the "thresholding throws away the signal" story we started with. The blog Limitations section should gain a line on the adaptive-adversary result.

## Caveats

- The adversary here is *static-optimal* (picks a fixed mean/spread); a fully reactive adversary vs an adaptive defender (recalibrating τ*) is the next step.
- Single proxy-noise baseline; the shape exploit assumes the adversary can control its own output variance, which maps to a real agent producing consistently-mediocre-but-never-terrible work.

## Reproduce

`/tmp/adaptive.py` (mean sweep) + the shape-exploit snippet in the PR. Core: calibrate each detector's alarm on benign (95th pct), then score constant-quality gaming agents at varying mean and output noise; report catch rate.
