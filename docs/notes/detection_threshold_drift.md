# Threshold-drift: a once-calibrated alarm fails silently — and AUROC can't see it

**Date**: 2026-05-25
**Follows**: `detection_tau_ablation.md` (which conjectured soft's residual advantage is being "threshold-free / drift-robust").
**Bottom line** (two drift types tested): At the **operating point**, the conjecture fails — under *location* drift a once-calibrated alarm's detection rate **collapses to ~0 for soft and binary alike**, while **AUROC stays high** (rank-based, drift-invariant); neither detector escapes recalibration, and AUROC can't see the failure. But for **discrimination under *scale/compression* drift, soft genuinely wins** — its ranking is affine-invariant while a fixed-threshold binary collapses to chance. So soft's real edge is *recalibration-free ranking*, not operating-point robustness. (See the two sections below.)

## Setup

Heterogeneous regime (`proxy_noise=0.09`), base rate 0.2, 8 seeds × 200 agents. We model **proxy calibration drift**: the monitor increasingly over-reports quality — every interaction's `p` inflates by `0.012 × (epoch − 6)`. Each detector's alarm threshold is calibrated **once** at epoch 6 (FPR ≤ 0.05 on benign), then held fixed. We track, over sliding 3-epoch windows, **AUROC** and the realized **false-alarm rate (FPR)** / **detection rate (TPR)** at that fixed alarm — with drift vs a no-drift control.

Detectors: soft toxicity, `bin@0.50` (naive threshold), `bin@0.78` (≈ class boundary, the best from the τ* ablation).

## Results

**AUROC (control / drift) — discrimination is preserved under drift:**

| epoch | soft | bin@0.50 | bin@0.78 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6  | 0.587 / 0.587 | 0.499 / 0.500 | 0.607 / 0.613 |
| 12 | 0.681 / 0.687 | 0.515 / 0.502 | 0.690 / 0.703 |
| 18 | 0.878 / 0.885 | 0.596 / 0.502 | 0.866 / 0.859 |
| 21 | 0.894 / 0.906 | 0.601 / 0.502 | 0.890 / 0.817 |

**Detection rate (TPR) at the once-calibrated alarm — collapses under drift:**

| epoch | soft ctl / drift | bin@0.78 ctl / drift |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | 0.041 / 0.003 | 0.031 / 0.003 |
| 15 | 0.175 / 0.003 | 0.109 / 0.003 |
| 18 | 0.381 / 0.006 | 0.312 / 0.006 |
| 21 | 0.456 / 0.000 | 0.388 / 0.000 |

(Realized benign FPR under drift also drifts toward 0.000 — the alarm goes *quiet*, which looks reassuring but is catastrophic: it's quiet because it's missing everything.)

## What this means

1. **AUROC is blind to operating-point drift.** It holds at 0.88–0.91 (soft) across the whole run, drift or not — because monotonic proxy inflation preserves the *ranking* of agents. Meanwhile the deployed alarm's detection rate falls from ~0.46 to ~0.00. **A monitor can look perfect on AUROC and catch nothing in production.** Evaluate monitors by realized FPR/TPR at the committed operating point, not by AUROC alone.

2. **Threshold-drift robustness is *not* a soft advantage.** Soft's committed alarm collapses exactly as hard as binary's (both → TPR ~0 under drift). The "soft is threshold-free, therefore drift-robust" idea from the τ* note does **not** hold: soft has no *internal* τ*, but it still needs an *operating* threshold on its score, and that threshold goes just as stale under drift. Both detectors require recalibration.

3. **Combined with the τ* ablation, the soft-vs-binary story is now much narrower.** With (a) the threshold placed at the class boundary and (b) regular recalibration, a binary detector matches soft on discrimination and fails/survives drift identically. Soft's genuine, remaining edge is *convenience* — one fewer threshold to tune (no internal τ*) and automatic, drift-agnostic *ranking* — not superior detection power or drift robustness at the operating point.

## Update: non-uniform (resolution-loss / compression) drift — soft *does* win here

The location drift above is rank-preserving, so AUROC is invariant for both detectors by construction. The fairer stress is a **scale/compression drift**: the proxy loses resolution over time (the faithful analogue of sigmoid-k flattening), modelled as `p' = 0.5 + (p − 0.5)·c(e)` with `c(e)` shrinking from 1.0 to 0.4. This is *not* rank-preserving for a per-agent mean, so soft and binary AUROC can diverge:

| epoch | soft (ctl/drift) | bin@0.78 (ctl/drift) |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | 0.681 / 0.679 | 0.690 / 0.636 |
| 18 | 0.878 / 0.877 | 0.866 / **0.500** |
| 21 | 0.894 / 0.894 | 0.890 / **0.500** |

![Compression drift: soft AUROC invariant, fixed-threshold binary collapses](../../runs/threshold_drift/compression_drift.png)
<!-- figure -> runs/threshold_drift/ (gitignored) -->

**Soft AUROC is invariant (Δ≈0.000); the fixed-boundary binary detector collapses to chance.** The per-agent soft score `mean(1−p′) = 0.5 − (mean_p − 0.5)·c` is an *affine, order-preserving* transform of `mean_p` with the same `c` for every agent — so agent ranking, hence AUROC, is unchanged. A fixed threshold has no such invariance: as the range compresses toward 0.5, both classes slide below 0.78 and the detector goes blind. (`bin@0.50` is also invariant here, but only because compression preserves the sign of `p−0.5` — and it's blind to begin with since both classes sit above 0.5.)

This **restores a genuine, mechanistic soft advantage** the location-drift result alone had hidden: **soft's discrimination is rank-invariant to affine proxy recalibration (both offset *and* gain); a fixed threshold survives an offset (it just relabels the optimal τ*) but not a gain change.** A threshold must be re-placed when the proxy's *scale* drifts; the soft ranking need not be.

## Synthesis across the three ablations

- **Discrimination (AUROC), static well-placed threshold** (`detection_tau_ablation.md`): binary ≈ soft, and binary can beat soft at higher noise. No soft advantage.
- **Discrimination under affine recalibration drift** (this note, compression): **soft wins** — ranking invariant to proxy offset+gain; a fixed threshold collapses under a gain change.
- **Deployed detection at a committed operating point under drift** (location-drift result above): **neither wins** — both alarms go stale and miss everything; recalibration is mandatory, and AUROC can't see the failure.

Net: soft's real edge is **recalibration-free *ranking* robustness**, not superior raw power and not a free pass on operating-point monitoring.

## Caveats

- Both drifts are uniform across the population and applied as post-hoc transforms on `p`; a per-agent or adversarial drift could differ.
- Single drift rate per condition; `bin@0.78` uses an oracle-ish boundary threshold.
- The control TPR rising over epochs is just degradation deepening (onsets 4/8/12); the *drift-vs-control gap* is the clean signal.

## Implication for the blog post

Together with `detection_tau_ablation.md`, this strongly indicates `docs/blog/soft-vs-binary-detection.md` overclaims. An honest reframe:
- Soft's advantage is **convenience and threshold-free ranking**, not strictly superior detection — a boundary-placed, regularly-recalibrated binary detector is competitive.
- The real operational lesson is **operating-point monitoring + recalibration under drift**, which *no* detector (soft or binary) escapes, and which **AUROC benchmarks hide**.

I'd recommend a dedicated "limitations / what we got wrong" follow-up rather than quietly editing the headline numbers.

## Reproduce

`/tmp/drift.py` in the PR description, or: calibrate each detector's alarm at an early window (95th-percentile of benign scores), inflate `p` by `DR·(epoch−E0)`, and compare realized TPR/FPR and AUROC across later windows with `DR>0` vs `DR=0`.
