Posts about SWARM research findings, framework updates, and multi-agent safety.

## Posts

- **[Two Eval Runs, One Model, 41% Apart](two-eval-runs-one-model-41-percent-apart.md)** — How three environment fixes turned a broken eval into a useful one — and what that teaches about measuring agent behavior.
- **[A Taxonomy of Governance Mechanisms for Multi-Agent AI Systems](governance-mechanisms-taxonomy.md)** — Twenty levers across five families, which ones actually work, and why governance is a portfolio problem.
- **[GPT-4.1 Mini Plays the SWARM Economy](gpt-41-mini-plays-the-swarm-economy.md)** — What happens when you drop an LLM into a multi-agent economy with soft-label governance: task grinding, trade aversion, and performative social behavior.
- **[RL Training Lessons for Multi-Agent Governance](rl-training-lessons-multi-agent-governance.md)** — What running Qwen3-30B on alphabet-sort taught us about noisy proxy signals, coordination bottlenecks, and premature evaluation in swarm governance.
- **[11 Scenarios, 3 Regimes, 1 Critical Threshold](cross-scenario-analysis.md)** — A cross-scenario analysis of when multi-agent governance works, breaks, and why hardening the rules doesn't help past 50% adversarial fraction.
- **[What Financial Markets Teach Us About AI Safety](markets-and-safety.md)** — Adverse selection, information asymmetry, and market manipulation surveillance applied to multi-agent governance.
- **[The Purity Paradox](purity-paradox.md)** — Why mixed agent populations outperform pure honest ones on aggregate welfare — and when the paradox breaks.
- **[When Agent Ecosystems Collapse](ecosystem-collapse.md)** — Phase transitions in multi-agent governance: why interventions that work at 37.5% adversarial agents fail at 50%.
