# We Red-Teamed the Contract Screening Mechanism. Collusion Is the Gap.

*8 attack scenarios, 2 governance configs, 1 finding that forced a threshold tuning session at 8am*

---

Our contract screening mechanism [produces perfect separation](contract-screening-separating-equilibrium.md) and [holds across 10 seeds](contract-screening-sweep-10-seeds.md). But separation is a static property: honest agents choose governed pools, adversaries stay in default. What happens when adversaries actively attack?

We ran SWARM's full red-team attack library against the contract screening governance configuration. The results exposed a gap we should have seen coming, and a false-positive problem we didn't.

## The attack library

SWARM's `RedTeamEvaluator` runs 8 attack scenarios against a governance config, each testing a different adversarial strategy:

| Attack | Category | Difficulty | Adversaries | Target lever |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Reputation Farming | exploitation | moderate | 1 | reputation_decay, circuit_breaker |
| Collusion Ring | coordination | advanced | 3 | collusion_detection, circuit_breaker |
| Threshold Dancing | evasion | advanced | 1 | circuit_breaker, random_audit |
| Sybil Attack | coordination | expert | 5 | vote_normalization, bandwidth_cap |
| Timing Attack | evasion | advanced | 1 | random_audit, circuit_breaker |
| Information Laundering | information | expert | 2 | circuit_breaker, collusion_detection |
| Resource Drain | resource | moderate | 2 | transaction_tax, staking |
| Governance Gaming | manipulation | expert | 1 | all |

Each attack is simulated probabilistically against the active governance levers, producing evasion rates, damage estimates, and detection latencies.

## Round 1: No collusion detection

The contract screening scenario shipped with staking, audits, circuit breakers, and a 2% transaction tax. No collusion detection.

**Score: 0.57 (F)**

| Attack | Result | Damage | Evasion |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Reputation Farming | **PREVENTED** | 13.2 | 18.5% |
| Collusion Ring | SUCCEEDED | 85.7 | 40.0% |
| Threshold Dancing | SUCCEEDED | 19.1 | 26.7% |
| Sybil Attack | SUCCEEDED | 105.8 | 29.6% |
| Timing Attack | **PREVENTED** | 23.8 | 33.3% |
| Information Laundering | **PREVENTED** | 42.3 | 29.6% |
| Resource Drain | **PREVENTED** | 52.9 | 37.0% |
| Governance Gaming | SUCCEEDED | 21.2 | 29.6% |

Two critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Collusion Ring** --- 3 coordinated adversaries caused 85.7 damage with 40% evasion. Without collusion detection, the circuit breaker only catches individual agents. Coordinated boosting flies under the radar.
2. **Sybil Attack** --- 5 independent-looking identities caused 105.8 damage. The highest damage of any attack. Without vote normalization or identity verification, Sybil attacks don't even need to infiltrate governed pools.

The pattern is clear: **coordination attacks dominate when collusion detection is absent.** The screening mechanism perfectly sorts individual agents, but it doesn't address coordinated behavior within the default pool.

## Round 2: Enable collusion detection

We added `collusion_detection_enabled: true` to the governance config. The first attempt used thresholds from the adversarial red-team scenario: `collusion_score_threshold: 0.4`, `collusion_correlation_threshold: 0.6`.

**It broke separation.**

After 20 epochs, separation quality flipped to -1.0. All honest agents ended up in the default pool. What happened?

### The false-positive trap

The collusion detector measures interaction frequency and benefit correlation between agent pairs. In a population of 10 agents with 5 honest agents concentrated in the Truthful Auction pool, those 5 agents interact with each other *constantly*. They're the only ones there.

The detector computed risk scores of ~0.75 for every honest agent. With a threshold of 0.4, every single agent got flagged. The collusion penalties drained their resources (some going to -89.0) and tanked their reputations (as low as -12.3). Agents with negative resources can't afford the bond to enter the Truthful Auction. They fell to the default pool.

The mechanism designed to protect honest agents destroyed them.

### Tuning the thresholds

The fix: raise thresholds above the baseline risk level that small-pool frequent interaction naturally produces.

| Parameter | Aggressive | Tuned |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `collusion_score_threshold` | 0.4 | **0.8** |
| `collusion_correlation_threshold` | 0.6 | **0.8** |
| `collusion_min_interactions` | 3 | **8** |
| `collusion_frequency_threshold` | 2.0 | **3.0** |
| `collusion_penalty_multiplier` | 2.0 | **1.0** |

With these thresholds, honest agents (risk ~0.75) stay below the 0.8 flagging threshold. Separation quality returned to 1.0 across all seeds. The collusion detector is now active but only triggers on genuinely anomalous coordination patterns.

## Round 2 results (tuned)

**Score: 0.61 (D)**

| Attack | Result | Damage (before) | Damage (after) | Change |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Reputation Farming | **PREVENTED** | 13.2 | 13.2 | — |
| Collusion Ring | SUCCEEDED | 85.7 | **21.4** | **-75%** |
| Threshold Dancing | SUCCEEDED | 19.1 | 19.1 | — |
| Sybil Attack | SUCCEEDED | 105.8 | 105.8 | — |
| Timing Attack | **PREVENTED** | 23.8 | 23.8 | — |
| Information Laundering | **PREVENTED** | 42.3 | 42.3 | — |
| Resource Drain | **PREVENTED** | 52.9 | 52.9 | — |
| Governance Gaming | SUCCEEDED | 21.2 | 21.2 | — |

The Collusion Ring damage dropped 75%, from 85.7 to 21.4. Evasion rate dropped from 40% to 10%. The collusion detector catches the coordination pattern and limits damage even when the attack technically succeeds.

Total damage dropped from 364.1 to 299.8. The critical Collusion Ring vulnerability is resolved.

**One critical vulnerability remains: the Sybil Attack** at 105.8 damage. Five independent-looking identities evade the collusion detector because they don't coordinate through the patterns the detector measures. This requires a different defense --- identity verification or vote normalization --- that's outside the current governance config.

## The tension

This exercise exposed a genuine design tension in multi-agent governance:

**Screening creates concentrated pools. Collusion detection flags concentrated interaction.**

These two mechanisms work at cross purposes. The screening mechanism succeeds *because* similar agents cluster together. The collusion detector raises alarms *because* agents cluster together. The only way to run both is to carefully tune thresholds so the detector's sensitivity sits between "normal pool concentration" and "actual adversarial coordination."

That gap exists --- honest agents scored ~0.75 risk, and a threshold of 0.8 separates them from genuine collusion. But it's a 0.05 margin. A slightly different population mix, pool size, or interaction pattern could close that gap.

### Implications for real deployments

1. **Governance mechanisms interact.** You can't evaluate mechanisms in isolation. Collusion detection that works perfectly on a flat population breaks a screened population.
2. **Small populations amplify false positives.** With 5 agents in a pool, everyone interacts with everyone. The base rate for "suspicious" interaction frequency is high. Larger populations would reduce this.
3. **Threshold tuning is fragile.** The 0.05 gap between honest-agent risk (0.75) and the flagging threshold (0.8) is narrow. Robust deployments need either wider margins or collusion detectors that account for pool structure.

## Reproduce it

```bash
# Red-team without collusion detection
python examples/run_redteam.py --mode full

# Red-team with collusion detection (uses current scenario config)
# See scenarios/contract_screening.yaml for tuned thresholds
```

## What's next

- **Pool-aware collusion detection:** Modify the detector to condition on pool membership, reducing false positives for agents who interact frequently because they're in the same governed pool
- **Sybil resistance:** Add identity verification or stake-weighted voting to address the remaining critical vulnerability
- **Adaptive red team:** Run adversaries that observe the collusion threshold and adjust coordination intensity to stay just below it
- **Larger populations:** Test whether the false-positive problem shrinks with 50--100 agents (it should --- interaction frequency distributes more evenly)
