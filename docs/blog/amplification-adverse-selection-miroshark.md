abstract: "The SWARM-to-MiroShark bridge hardcoded accepted=True, pinning quality_gap and spread at 0. The obvious fix - rejection from dislikes/reports - was dead: those counters are identically zero in every MiroShark run. We defined acceptance by amplification instead (content other agents quoted/replied/liked/reposted is accepted; ignored content is rejected), with p judged independently so quality_gap stays non-circular - and that method is the durable result. Single runs then showed a tempting selection signal: the concentrated libel cascade more adversely selected than diffuse red-teaming, an ordering even robust to swapping the LLM judge. We did not stop there. A preregistered fixed-regime multi-seed follow-up did NOT replicate the libel<redteam<0 ordering (libel ≈ redteam, one extra draw collapsed it); combined with its non-robustness to regenerating the simulation and judge-dominated absolute toxicity/welfare, the lesson is that the headline ordering is regime-fragile, not a property. This post is primarily a cautionary tale about LLM-judged, single-seed safety metrics - and a worked example of preregistering the test that retired our own headline."

# When the Crowd Amplifies the Worst — and When the Metric Doesn't Hold

*MiroShark's agents never press "report," so we measured rejection by amplification. Single runs gave us a clean adverse-selection ordering — then a preregistered multi-seed follow-up failed to reproduce it. The non-circular metric is the keeper; the headline ordering isn't.*

## The metric that was always zero

[MiroShark](https://github.com/aaronjmars/MiroShark) spawns hundreds of grounded LLM agents that react to a seed briefing across Twitter/Reddit-style platforms. Our bridge pipes each agent action through SWARM's `SoftMetrics` to ask the distributional-safety question: is the ecosystem *selecting* for low quality?

That question is `quality_gap`:

```
quality_gap = E[p | accepted] - E[p | rejected]
```

where `p ∈ [0,1]` is the probability an action is a constructive contribution. A *negative* quality gap is the signature of **adverse selection**: what gets through is *worse* on average than what doesn't.

The bridge hardcoded `accepted=True` for every interaction. With nothing ever rejected, `quality_gap` and `spread` were structurally pinned at `0`. The metric existed; it could never fire.

## The obvious fix was dead on arrival

MiroShark posts carry `num_dislikes` and `num_reports`. The plan: content with reports, or more dislikes than likes, is "rejected."

It doesn't survive contact with the data. Across **every** MiroShark run:

- `num_dislikes`: identically `0`
- `num_reports`: identically `0`
- No `DISLIKE`/`REPORT`/`BLOCK` action types exist at all
- `num_likes`: a handful of non-zero values, max 3

MiroShark's agents never down-vote, report, or block. Binding acceptance to those counters leaves everything `accepted=True` — the original bug, with extra code.

## Amplification *is* the selection signal

What MiroShark agents *do* do is engage with each other's content — 313 of 379 actions in the libel run reference a specific prior post or comment. That engagement graph is the selection mechanism:

> A created post/comment/quote is **accepted** if another agent amplified it — quoted, replied to, liked, or reposted it. Content nobody touched is **rejected** (ignored).

`p` is judged independently: an LLM scores each action's constructiveness from its content alone, with no knowledge of who amplified it. Acceptance comes from the engagement graph; quality from the content. They never see each other, so `quality_gap` is a real selection measurement, not a tautology.

## The tempting result: concentration *appeared* to amplify adverse selection

> **Read this section as the hypothesis, not the conclusion.** The ordering below looked robust across judges in single runs — but the preregistered multi-seed follow-up ([Update, 2026-05-18](#update-2026-05-18-the-preregistered-powered-follow-up-did-not-replicate-the-ordering)) did **not** reproduce it. Kept here because the *reasoning* that made it tempting, and how it failed, is the point of the post.

With acceptance defined by amplification, the concentrated libel cascade (a few injector/amplifier agents pumping a false narrative) showed a **more negative quality_gap** than diffuse red-teaming in single runs. And — temptingly — that *ordering* survived swapping the LLM judge:

| Run (5 rounds) | Judge | quality_gap | spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| Libel cascade | grok-4.1-fast | **−0.059** | +0.030 |
| Red-team (run A) | grok-4.1-fast | **−0.037** | +0.010 |
| Libel cascade | grok-4.3 | **−0.027** | +0.014 |
| Red-team (run A) | grok-4.3 | **−0.022** | +0.006 |

Under *both* judges, in these single runs: `libel < redteam < 0` — robust to a judge swap (grok-4.3 just compresses magnitudes ~50%). That judge-robustness is exactly what made it tempting to call a finding. It was not one: regenerating the simulation kills it (next section), and the preregistered multi-seed study could not reproduce it (Update). What *does* survive is the weaker, methodological point — aggregate toxicity barely distinguishes these two worlds while a *selection* metric at least responds to them, which is the argument for developing distributional, selection-aware metrics, not evidence about libel vs. red-team specifically.

## The result that doesn't hold: the signal is single-seed

Then we ran a *fresh* red-team simulation (run B) to add a clean third data point. Same scenario, same grok-4.3 judge — only the simulation model differed (grok-4.1-fast is deprecated; run B was generated with grok-4.3):

| Run (5 rounds, grok-4.3 judge) | quality_gap |
|---|---|
| Red-team **run A** (grok-4.1-fast sim) | −0.022 |
| Red-team **run B** (grok-4.3 sim) | **+0.001** |

Same scenario, same judge, regenerated simulation: the adverse-selection signal **vanishes**. It is single-seed and not robust to the simulation regime. We cannot honestly claim red-teaming exhibits adverse selection as a property — only that *one* generated red-team world did, under one judge.

## Two things broke, and they matter more than the headline

**Absolute metrics are judge artifacts.** Switching the judge from grok-4.1-fast to grok-4.3 on *identical* simulation data:

| Metric (libel cascade, same data) | grok-4.1-fast | grok-4.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Toxicity (accepted) | 0.28 | 0.61 |
| Avg quality (accepted) | 0.72 | 0.39 |
| Net welfare | +159 | −277 |

Toxicity doubles, welfare flips strongly negative — from a judge change alone. **Absolute toxicity/welfare are properties of the judge, not the scenario.** Only the *relative, within-judge* comparison (`quality_gap` ordering) carried any signal across the change.

**The selection signal is fragile.** It survives a judge swap in sign and ordering, but not a simulation re-roll. One seed per scenario is not a finding; it is an anecdote with a confidence interval we didn't compute.

## What to actually take away

- **The amplification-as-acceptance method is sound and now shipped.** It unpins `quality_gap`/`spread` and is non-circular. That is the durable contribution.
- **Selection-aware metrics surface structure that aggregate toxicity hides** — the libel-vs-redteam ordering is invisible to a toxicity count and visible to `quality_gap`, robustly across judges.
- **But:** the specific magnitudes, the absolute toxicity/welfare, and even the *existence* of redteam adverse selection are not robust to single-seed variance, simulation model, or judge model. Treat them as hypotheses, not results.
- **Next:** a multi-seed study under a single fixed model regime (sim + judge), with confidence intervals, before any of the magnitudes are quoted as findings.

This post started as "the crowd amplifies the worst." It ended as "the crowd amplified the worst in the runs we happened to generate, the ordering looked judge-robust, and then we preregistered the replication and it did not hold." We ran the test that retired our own headline — that is the honest version, and the one worth publishing.

## Update (2026-05-18): the preregistered powered follow-up did not replicate the ordering

The "Next" above was attempted. We preregistered a fixed-regime multi-seed study (hypotheses, fixed N, stopping rule, and an explicit no-reproducible-seeds caveat written and SHA-256-hashed *before* any run — `sha256 386420a3…`; orchestrator `scripts/multiseed_miroshark.py`): grok-4.3 for **both** the MiroShark SMART/NER simulation and the metrics judge, scale=3, 5 rounds, target ≥8 independent stochastic replications per scenario.

It did not complete. A cascade of *infrastructure* failures — a dead ambient judge API key silently degrading every verdict to p=0.5, a wedged Docker engine taking Neo4j down, and a hard recurring **OpenAI daily-request-cap exhaustion on MiroShark's ontology step** — capped us at **n=3 clean replications per scenario**, well short of the preregistered ≥8. So this is **still underpowered and not confirmatory.** But the indicative direction is itself the point:

| Preregistered metric (grok-4.3 sim+judge, clean runs) | n | mean `quality_gap` | bootstrap 95% CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| libel cascade | 3 | **−0.064** | [−0.171, +0.063] |
| red-team | 3 | **−0.067** | [−0.152, +0.020] |

- **H1** (libel < redteam): Δ = **+0.002**, 95% CI [−0.133, +0.138], Welch t≈0.03 — **not supported**.
- **H2** (libel < 0): CI includes 0 — **not supported**.
- **H3** (redteam ≈ 0): CI includes 0 — **fail to reject** (consistent).

A single additional libel draw (qg ≈ +0.06) collapsed the libel mean from −0.13 (at n=2) toward redteam's and exploded its variance. **The `libel < redteam < 0` ordering claimed above is not robust across independent stochastic draws even within one fixed regime** — exactly the fragility this post warned about, now observed under the controlled conditions it asked for, not just across judge/sim swaps. The judge-robust ordering claim in the front-matter should be read strictly as "what the single-seed runs showed," not as a replicated property.

The powered ≥8/scenario study remains open (beads `distributional-agi-safety-qopt`), blocked on the external OpenAI ontology-model quota, not on anything in SWARM. The preregistration, per-run manifest, and indicative `SUMMARY.md` live in the (gitignored) batch dir `runs/20260517-142704_multiseed_miroshark/`; they are **not** yet in `swarm-artifacts` because the study is incomplete — they will be archived only when a powered run finishes, to avoid presenting an aborted batch as a result.

## Raw data & reproduction

All three five-round runs — `export.json`, the grok-4.3 `metrics.json`/`judgments.json`, *and* the preserved grok-4.1-fast judge outputs that make the controlled comparison possible — are archived in [`swarm-artifacts/research/miroshark-amplification/`](https://github.com/swarm-ai-research/swarm-artifacts/tree/main/research/miroshark-amplification), with a README walking the full table and reproduction commands. The amplification metric itself is `swarm/bridges/miroshark/metrics.py` in the main repo. Inspect the judgments, disagree with our `p` calls, re-run with a different judge — the point of publishing the raw runs is that the fragility above is checkable, not asserted.
