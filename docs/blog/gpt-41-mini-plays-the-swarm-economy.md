# GPT-4.1 Mini Plays the SWARM Economy

*What happens when you drop an LLM into a multi-agent economy with honest, opportunistic, and deceptive bots — and score everything with soft labels?*

---

We built a [Verifiers](https://github.com/VerifierIntelli/verifiers)-based RL environment that implements the SWARM economy: an LLM agent interacting with programmatic bots through tasks, trades, and social actions under governance constraints. Then we ran GPT-4.1-mini through 80 rollouts and measured what it actually does.

The short version: it's a diligent worker, a terrible socializer, and it has no idea how to trade.

## The environment

The SWARM Economy environment drops an LLM agent into a 25-step simulation (5 epochs of 5 steps) alongside 3 programmatic agents:

- **Honest bots** — cooperate consistently, accept proposals, submit thorough work
- **Opportunistic bots** — cherry-pick high-reward tasks, free-ride on social engagement
- **Deceptive bots** — build trust for 5 interactions, then exploit with bad trades and low-quality work

The LLM has 9 tools: `post`, `reply`, `vote`, `propose_trade`, `accept_proposal`, `reject_proposal`, `claim_task`, `submit_work`, and `pass_turn`. Every interaction is scored using SWARM's soft-label pipeline — proxy signals are combined into `v_hat`, passed through a calibrated sigmoid to get `p = P(beneficial)`, and payoffs are computed as `stake * (2p - 1)`.

Governance runs continuously: 4.9% tax per step, 13.2% audit risk on submissions, 2% reputation decay, and a circuit breaker that freezes agents below reputation 10.

## Results: 80 rollouts, 4 metrics

| Metric | Avg | Std |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Composite reward** | 0.830 | 0.092 |
| **Payoff reward** | 0.701 | 0.101 |
| **Reputation reward** | 0.430 | 0.042 |
| **Survival rate** | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| **Interaction quality** | 0.297 | 0.060 |

The composite reward weights payoff at 1.0 and reputation at 0.3. GPT-4.1-mini scored well on both, and achieved perfect survival — no rollout hit the circuit breaker.

## What GPT-4.1-mini actually does

The behavioral breakdown tells a clearer story than the aggregate scores:

| Action | Avg calls/rollout | What it means |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| `claim_task` | 6.9 | Aggressively claims tasks (many fail — already taken by bots) |
| `submit_work` | 3.1 | Completes ~3 tasks per rollout with good quality |
| `pass_turn` | 3.0 | Goes idle when no tasks are available |
| `post` | 1.3 | Posts motivational community messages |
| `reject_proposal` | 0.9 | Defensively rejects most incoming trade proposals |
| `vote` | 0.2 | Barely votes |
| `propose_trade` | 0.06 | Almost never initiates trades |
| `accept_proposal` | 0.03 | Almost never accepts trades |
| `reply` | 0.0 | Never replies to posts — zero across all 80 rollouts |

Three patterns stand out:

**1. Task grinding works.** The model learned (or already knows) that claiming tasks and submitting detailed work is the highest-payoff strategy. Its submissions consistently scored p > 0.8, earning bounties of 8-17 resources per task. In the example rollout, "Create community engagement report" scored p=0.86 and "Analyze resource allocation proposal" scored p=0.87. The proxy evaluator rewards length, keywords like "thorough" and "analysis", and effort signals — and GPT-4.1-mini hits all three without any RL training on this environment.

**2. Social behavior is performative and unidirectional.** The model posts motivational messages ("Committed to contributing quality work and fostering community collaboration") but never replies to other agents' posts and barely votes. It treats the social layer as a reputation-farming mechanism, not a communication channel. This is rational given the reward structure — posting gives +0.5 reputation, which is cheap insurance against reputation decay.

**3. Trade is a dead zone.** Across 80 rollouts, GPT-4.1-mini proposed ~5 total trades and accepted ~2. It rejected ~73. This extreme trade aversion is arguably correct — the deceptive bot sends exploitative proposals (offered_transfer: -15.0) disguised as "exclusive partnership opportunities," and the model learned to just say no to everything. But it also means it's leaving cooperative value on the table with honest bots.

## The interaction quality puzzle

The most interesting metric is interaction quality: 0.297 average. This measures `successful_interactions / total_interactions`, where "successful" means the soft label exceeded 0.5. At first glance, 29.7% seems low for a model that consistently produces good work.

The explanation is in the denominator. Every tool call counts as an interaction — including failed task claims, community posts, and rejected proposals. The model averages 15.5 tool calls per rollout but only 3.1 successful task submissions. All those `claim_task` calls on already-claimed tasks, `post` calls, and `reject_proposal` calls dilute the ratio.

This reveals a metric design issue: interaction quality as currently defined penalizes exploratory behavior and defensive actions. A model that only acts when certain of success would score higher on this metric but would also be less adaptive. We should probably split this into task-specific quality (`successful_submissions / total_submissions`) and overall activity quality.

## What 62.5% idle-stop tells us

The stop condition breakdown is revealing: 62.5% of rollouts ended because the model stopped calling tools (went idle), while 37.5% hit the 25-step maximum. The model doesn't always use all its turns.

Looking at the `num_turns` distribution, there's a clear bimodal pattern: rollouts cluster around 5 turns (model gives up early) and 25 turns (runs the full simulation). The 5-turn rollouts correspond to scenarios where the model claims a task, submits work, posts once, and then can't find anything else to do — it passes a turn or two and then stops generating tool calls entirely.

This is the "task starvation" problem. With 3 programmatic bots also claiming tasks, and only 2-3 tasks spawned per epoch, the LLM often finds nothing available. Rather than engaging in social actions or proposing trades to fill time, it goes idle. An RL-trained version of this model would presumably learn to use downtime more productively.

## Connecting to SWARM governance findings

These eval results echo several findings from the SWARM simulation framework:

**Trade aversion parallels adverse selection.** The model's refusal to trade mirrors what we see in high-adversarial scenarios — when agents can't distinguish honest from deceptive counterparties, the rational response is to avoid the market entirely. This is textbook adverse selection (Akerlof 1970). The governance implication: reputation signals need to be strong enough that cooperative trade becomes distinguishable from exploitation.

**Reputation farming is cheap.** At +0.5 per post with 2% decay per step, the model can maintain reputation almost indefinitely through low-effort posting. This means reputation alone doesn't measure genuine contribution — it measures activity. The SWARM framework's collusion detection layer exists precisely for this reason: individual reputation is gameable; pattern-based detection across the interaction graph is harder to fake.

**100% survival doesn't mean 100% healthy.** Every rollout survived the circuit breaker, but reputation steadily declined from 50 to ~47-49 over 25 steps despite task completion and posting. In a longer simulation, this erosion would eventually matter. The 2% decay rate means reputation halves every ~35 steps, so a 100-step simulation would require sustained high-quality engagement just to stay above the freeze threshold.

## Next steps

This is a baseline eval — GPT-4.1-mini with no RL training on the SWARM Economy environment. The natural next step is to train on it using Prime Intellect's RL infrastructure (the same setup we used for the [alphabet-sort training run](rl-training-lessons-multi-agent-governance.md)).

Specific things we want to test:

1. **Does RL training unlock trading?** The current model avoids trades entirely. Can reward shaping teach it to distinguish honest from deceptive proposals and engage in cooperative exchange?
2. **Does social behavior become strategic?** Right now, posting is reputation farming. Can training produce genuine social coordination — replying to other agents, voting strategically, building alliances?
3. **How does performance change with adversarial pressure?** The default environment is "medium" difficulty. Running the same eval with 0 honest / 2 opportunistic / 2 deceptive bots would test whether the model adapts its strategy or collapses.
4. **Multi-model comparison.** Running the same eval against Claude, Llama, and Qwen models would show whether these behavioral patterns are model-specific or universal LLM tendencies.
