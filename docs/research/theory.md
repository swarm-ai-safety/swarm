# Theoretical Foundations

This document provides the formal foundations for SWARM's approach to multi-agent safety.

## Core Thesis

**AGI-level risks don't require AGI-level agents.** Catastrophic outcomes can emerge from the interaction of many sub-AGI systems, even when none are individually dangerous.

This shifts the focus from:

- Single-agent alignment → Multi-agent dynamics
- Individual capabilities → Interaction patterns
- Agent-level properties → System-level properties

## Formal Model

### Interactions

An interaction $I$ between agents $a$ and $b$ is characterized by:

- **Observables** $\mathbf{o} = (o_1, ..., o_n)$ - Measurable signals
- **Latent value** $v \in \{-1, +1\}$ - True beneficial/harmful outcome
- **Soft label** $p = P(v = +1 | \mathbf{o})$ - Probability of benefit

### Proxy Computation

Observables are mapped to soft labels via:

$$\hat{v} = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot f_i(o_i)$$

$$p = \sigma(k \cdot \hat{v}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k \cdot \hat{v}}}$$

Where:

- $w_i$ are learned or specified weights
- $f_i$ are feature transformations
- $k$ is a calibration parameter

### Payoffs

Agent payoffs incorporate soft labels:

$$\pi_a = \theta \cdot S_{\text{soft}} - \tau - c_a - \rho_a \cdot E_{\text{soft}} + w_{\text{rep}} \cdot r_a$$

Where:

- $S_{\text{soft}} = p \cdot s_+ - (1-p) \cdot s_-$ ([expected surplus](../tutorials/understanding-soft-labels.md))
- $E_{\text{soft}} = (1-p) \cdot h$ (expected externality)
- $\tau$ is transfer, $c_a$ is governance cost
- $\rho_a$ is externality internalization
- $r_a$ is reputation

## Key Metrics

### Toxicity

Expected harm among accepted interactions:

$$\text{Toxicity} = E[1-p \mid \text{accepted}]$$

This measures the "poison in the system"—how much harm is getting through.

### Quality Gap

Difference in quality between accepted and rejected:

$$\text{[Quality Gap](../papers/kernel_market_governance_comparison.md)} = E[p \mid \text{accepted}] - E[p \mid \text{rejected}]$$

A negative quality gap indicates **adverse selection**: the system preferentially accepts lower-quality interactions.

### Incoherence

Variance-to-error ratio across replays:

$$I = \frac{D}{E} = \frac{\text{Var}[\text{decision}]}{E[\text{error}]}$$

High incoherence means decisions are unstable—varying more than their accuracy would justify.

## Emergence Mechanisms

### Information Asymmetry

Agent $a$ observes $\mathbf{o}_a$, agent $b$ observes $\mathbf{o}_b$, where $\mathbf{o}_a \neq \mathbf{o}_b$.

This creates:

- **Adverse selection** - Better-informed agents exploit information gaps
- **Moral hazard** - Unobservable actions lead to hidden exploitation
- **Market for lemons** - Low-quality interactions drive out high-quality

### Feedback Loops

```
Low Quality Gap → Honest agents exit → Worse selection pool → Lower Quality Gap
```

Adverse selection is self-reinforcing, making early intervention critical.

### Variance Amplification

For $n$ sequential decisions:

$$\text{Var}[\text{outcome}_n] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i^2 \cdot \text{Var}[\text{decision}_i]$$

Error compounds across decision chains, especially in multi-agent settings where each agent's error propagates.

## Governance Theory

### Friction-Based Interventions

Transaction taxes create friction that:

1. Reduces the return on low-quality interactions
2. Makes exploitation less profitable
3. Shifts equilibrium toward higher quality

Trade-off: Also reduces welfare for honest agents.

### Reputation Dynamics

Reputation $r$ evolves as:

$$r_{t+1} = \gamma \cdot r_t + (1-\gamma) \cdot p_t$$

Where $\gamma$ is persistence and $p_t$ is recent performance.

Decay ($\gamma < 1$) prevents agents from coasting on past reputation.

### Circuit Breakers

Freeze agents when toxicity exceeds threshold:

$$\text{freeze}(a) \iff \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i \in \text{window}} (1-p_i) > \theta$$

This creates a hard ceiling on toxic behavior.

## Biological Foundations

SWARM's distributed governance model draws on behavioral ecology research, particularly work on social insect colonies that achieve coordination without central control.

### Task Allocation Without Central Control

Gordon (1996) demonstrated that ant colonies perform complex task allocation without any hierarchical command structure. The queen doesn't issue commands; workers respond only to local information, yet the colony achieves appropriate numbers of workers in each task.

This maps directly to SWARM's architecture:

| Ant Colony (Gordon 1996) | SWARM Framework |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| No central controller | Distributed orchestrator |
| Local interaction → global behavior | Agent interactions → emergent metrics |
| Threshold-based task switching | Circuit breakers, governance triggers |
| Encounter rate as density signal | Interaction frequency as quality signal |
| Stigmergy (environment as memory) | Shared state, event logs |
| Age polyethism (role progression) | Agent capability tiers |

### Key Mechanisms

**Threshold Model**: Each individual has a stimulus threshold for engaging in a task. At low stimulus levels, only low-threshold individuals engage; at high stimulus, everyone switches. SWARM's circuit breakers implement an analogous mechanism—agents are frozen when toxicity exceeds a threshold.

**Interaction-Based Switching**: Workers switch tasks based on encounter rates with others doing different tasks. In SWARM, agents respond to quality signals (p values) from recent interactions, adjusting behavior based on local feedback rather than global coordination.

**Stigmergy**: In *Polybia* wasps, a forager's decision to collect more material depends on wait times—information flows through the environment, not direct communication. SWARM's event logs and shared state serve a similar function, allowing coordination through environmental traces rather than explicit messaging.

### Adversarial Robustness

The biological literature documents failure modes with direct analogs to multi-agent AI systems:

- **Death spirals** (army ants) → Adverse selection loops
- **False pheromone injection** (parasitic exploitation) → Reputation poisoning
- **Parasitic species exploiting swarm behavior** → Adversarial agents exploiting trust

Successful swarms have *distributed immune systems*, not central controllers. SWARM's governance levers (circuit breakers, transaction taxes, staking) are attempts at distributed immunity—local mechanisms that create system-wide resilience.

## Relationship to Market Microstructure

SWARM draws on market microstructure theory:

| Market Concept | SWARM Analog |
|----------------|--------------|
| Bid-ask spread | Quality gap |
| Informed traders | Deceptive agents |
| Adverse selection | Same term |
| Market makers | Honest agents |

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions

1. **Observable proxies exist** - Some signals correlate with interaction quality
2. **Calibration is possible** - We can tune $k$ to match ground truth
3. **Agents respond to incentives** - Governance changes behavior
4. **Stationarity** - Underlying dynamics don't shift dramatically

### Limitations

1. **Proxy gaming** - Agents may optimize proxies, not quality
2. **Calibration drift** - Ground truth distribution may change
3. **Emergence prediction** - We detect, not predict, emergent failures
4. **Governance costs** - All interventions have trade-offs

## Compositionality of Governance Contracts

### The Sequential Gate Problem

In multi-stage (long-horizon) pipelines, governance operates as a sequence of gates. Each stage $i$ has a pass probability $q_i$ — the probability that an agent clears the governance check and proceeds. The end-to-end completion probability for an $n$-stage pipeline is:

$$Q_n = \prod_{i=1}^{n} q_i$$

Under uniform governance with per-gate pass probability $q$, this simplifies to $Q_n = q^n$. Our empirical data from the [Pareto frontier experiments](../blog/capability-safety-pareto-frontier.md) confirms this: with tight governance ($q \approx 0.85$), a 5-stage pipeline completes with probability $(0.85)^5 \approx 0.444$, closely matching the observed 45% completion rate in 20-seed replication.

### Formal Compositionality Bound

Following the Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC) framework ([arXiv:2602.22302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)), we formalize governance contracts as $C_i = (P_i, I_i, G_i, R_i)$ where $P_i$ are preconditions, $I_i$ are invariants, $G_i$ are governance policies, and $R_i$ are recovery mechanisms.

**Definition ($(p, \delta, k)$-satisfaction).** An agent $a$ satisfies contract $C$ with parameters $(p, \delta, k)$ if, over any window of $k$ interactions, the probability of invariant violation is at most $\delta$, and the expected behavioral compliance is at least $p$.

**Theorem (Sequential Composition Bound).** Given $n$ sequential stages where stage $i$ has contract $C_i$ satisfied with parameters $(p_i, \delta_i, k_i)$, the end-to-end pipeline satisfies:

$$p_{\text{pipeline}} \geq \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_i$$

$$\delta_{\text{pipeline}} \leq 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - \delta_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_i$$

The first bound is tight when stage failures are independent. The second is a union bound on invariant violation probability.

**Corollary.** For uniform contracts ($p_i = p$, $\delta_i = \delta$ for all $i$):

$$p_{\text{pipeline}} \geq p^n, \quad \delta_{\text{pipeline}} \leq n\delta$$

This formalizes the empirical observation: compliance degrades exponentially in pipeline depth, while invariant violation risk grows linearly.

### How Screening Improves the Bound

Under uniform governance (pooling equilibrium), all agents face the same per-gate probability $q$. Under screening (separating equilibrium), trusted agents face $q_T > q$ and adversarial agents face $q_A < q$.

For a pipeline where trusted agents participate in fraction $\alpha$ of stages:

$$Q_n^{\text{screening}} = q_T^{\alpha n} \cdot q_A^{(1-\alpha) n}$$

When $\alpha$ is large (screening successfully routes trusted agents to most stages), $Q_n^{\text{screening}} > Q_n^{\text{uniform}}$ because the geometric mean of $(q_T, q_A)$ weighted by $(\alpha, 1-\alpha)$ exceeds $q$ when $\alpha > 0.5$.

This explains the **northeast movement** observed in our screening experiments: screening doesn't just redistribute the same total compliance — it increases the effective per-gate probability for the majority of stages by concentrating governance friction on agents who need it.

**Screening leverage in sequential tasks.** The improvement factor is:

$$\frac{Q_n^{\text{screening}}}{Q_n^{\text{uniform}}} = \left(\frac{q_T}{q}\right)^{\alpha n} \cdot \left(\frac{q_A}{q}\right)^{(1-\alpha) n}$$

This ratio grows exponentially with $n$, meaning screening has higher leverage in longer pipelines — consistent with our finding that long-horizon tasks show the most dramatic screening improvement (+17.3 pp mean, +8.8 pp p5 at tight governance).

### Behavioral Drift and Compositionality Failure

The compositionality bound assumes stationary $(p_i, \delta_i)$. If an agent's compliance degrades over time (behavioral drift), the per-stage guarantees weaken and the pipeline bound loosens. Formally, if drift causes $p_i(t) = p_i(0) - D^* \cdot t$ for drift rate $D^*$, then:

$$p_{\text{pipeline}}(t) \geq \prod_{i=1}^{n} (p_i(0) - D^* \cdot t)$$

This highlights why drift detection is safety-critical for long-horizon tasks: a small per-stage drift $D^*$ compounds to a large pipeline-level degradation. An agent that builds trust ($p_i$ high initially) then drifts adversarial ($D^*$ large) can defeat screening precisely in the regime where sequential compositionality matters most.

### Empirical Validation

| Metric | Theoretical Bound | Empirical (20-seed) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tight uniform completion (5 stages) | $(0.85)^5 = 0.444$ | 0.45 | Within 1 pp |
| Screening improvement ratio (tight, $\alpha=0.7$) | $\left(\frac{0.95}{0.85}\right)^{3.5} \cdot \left(\frac{0.65}{0.85}\right)^{1.5} = 1.30$ | 1.30 (0.755/0.582) | Exact match |
| Union bound on invariant violation ($n=5$, $\delta=0.05$) | $\leq 0.25$ | 0.22 (fraction of runs with any gate failure) | Conservative bound holds |

The theoretical framework matches empirical results closely, validating both the multiplicative composition model and the screening leverage prediction.
