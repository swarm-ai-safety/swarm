# Selection-geometry AUROC study

**Question.** The new projection-geometric metrics
(`quality_correlation` ρ(p,a), `selection_saturation` |Q|·√(αβ)/σ_p,
`baseline_harm` 1−E[p], `selection_credit` β·Q) were motivated as
cleaner cross-scenario signals than raw toxicity. Does that hold up
when the discrimination task is set up to be *hard*?

> **v1 → v2 revision.** The first version of this study (committed
> with `f_low=0.10, f_high=0.40, N=200, noiseless v̂`) hit AUROC=1.000
> on multiple metrics — saturated discrimination, no useful
> comparison. v2 below tightens the contrast to a 5pp f-gap with
> N=50 batches and noisy `v̂`, so the metrics actually compete.
> Conclusions below differ in *location* (which θ saturation is best
> at) and in *strength* (no non-trivial metric hits 1.0).

## Procedure

- For adversarial fractions f ∈ {0.05, 0.10, …, 0.45}, compose
  populations of N=**50** interactions by mixing benign + toxic
  fixture batches.
- For governor strictnesses θ ∈ {−0.6, −0.3, 0.0, +0.3, +0.6}, label
  acceptance as `(v̂ + ε) > θ` with ε ~ 𝒩(0, σ=0.25). The noise on
  `v̂` keeps the governor from being a perfect oracle on `p` — without
  it the acceptance rule is a deterministic function of `p` and the
  discrimination is artificially trivial.
- Five metrics on every (f, θ, seed) cell; K=**400** seeds per cell
  → 18 000 cells total, ~12 s single-core.
- Binary label: *adversarial* if f ≥ 0.30, *benign* if f ≤ 0.25 — a
  5-percentage-point gap. AUROC per (metric, θ) pooled across those
  cells.

Reproduce: `python -m experiments.selection_geometry_auroc --seed 2026`.

adversarial-low direction were negated before scoring.)

### Three findings

**1. `baseline_harm` ≈ 1.000 is a *real* result, not an artifact —
and it pins down when the new metrics actually matter.** It says:
*if* you can directly measure `E[p]`, the population mean dominates
everything else as a discriminator. In a real deployment you don't
get `p` for free — you observe `v̂` plus the accept/reject decision,
and the proxy is noisy. The selection-geometry metrics are designed
for that observational regime. So the load-bearing comparison is
the *bottom four rows*: among signals that **only see the selection
process**, which one carries the most information?

**2. Toxicity and saturation cross over at θ ≈ 0, sweeping the same
total AUROC budget across opposite halves of the governor space.**

   - **Lax governors (θ < 0):** raw `toxicity` AUROC 0.89–0.98;
     saturation 0.47–0.50. Toxicity is the right tool when the
     governor admits most interactions, because toxicity collapses
     to baseline harm (β → 1 ⇒ T → 1 − E[p]).
   - **Strict governors (θ > 0):** roles invert. `toxicity` 0.51–0.53
     (chance); `saturation` 0.87–0.88. Under heavy filtering the
     few accepted interactions don't carry population info; what
     does is the geometric question "how much sorting signal is the
     proxy giving us, relative to its theoretical ceiling?"

   Mean AUROC across all θ is nearly tied (0.712 vs 0.685). The
   value isn't that saturation *beats* toxicity in aggregate — it's
   that the two signals are **complementary** in opposite regimes,
   and saturation fills the strict-θ gap where toxicity reverts to
   chance. Practically: if your governor's acceptance rate is
   <50%, report saturation; if >50%, report toxicity; near 50%,
   report both (this is exactly what `MetricsReporter` now does).

**3. `quality_gap` strictly worsens with strictness — and goes
*wrong-direction* under strict governors.** AUROC drops from 0.798
to 0.017 across the θ sweep. Combined with `quality_correlation`
mean 0.315 (also wrong-direction throughout), these confirm the
v1 finding's reframing: **ρ(p,a) and Q measure sorting quality
given the population, not the population given the sorting.** Use
them to compare governors against a fixed population, not to
detect adversarial populations against a fixed governor.

### Why the location flipped from v1

In v1 (noiseless `v̂`, N=200), saturation peaked at θ=0. With a
deterministic governor and large batches, the balanced regime is
where the most sorting work happens (both α and β substantial), so
|Q| · √(αβ) is maximized — and saturation along with it.

In v2 (noisy `v̂`, N=50), the noise smears `v̂` so that even a "lax"
threshold makes mistakes, and a "strict" threshold rejects only the
clearest-positive proxies. The strict regime now selects an
acceptance set whose `p` distribution is much narrower than the
rejection set's — so the sorting signal `|Q|` is *huge* relative to
the small σ_p of the accepted slice. Saturation grows with θ
because the bound `σ_p/√(αβ)` shrinks faster than `|Q|` does.

This is the right shape for a real-world story: when the governor
is doing aggressive filtering, saturation tells you whether the
proxy is hitting its ceiling.

## Implications

- **Report saturation alongside toxicity in every per-epoch
  summary** — they're complementary, not redundant.
  `MetricsReporter.format_report()` and `to_markdown()` already do
  this; sweeps and dashboards should follow.
- **Acceptance rate is the regime selector.** Below ~50% acceptance,
  trust saturation over toxicity; above, the reverse. The
  `plot_selection_geometry()` two-panel view encodes exactly this
  decomposition.
- **Don't use ρ(p,a) to detect adversarial populations.** It's a
  governor-quality metric given the population. Use it for A/B
  comparisons of governors, not for population monitoring.

## Limits and unresolved

- Fixture populations aren't adaptive. An evasive adversary would
  push `v̂` close to θ on purpose, which collapses σ_p of the
  accepted slice further and would push saturation higher still —
  but it would also push `p` closer to the threshold, potentially
  *lowering* `baseline_harm` AUROC. Worth running with an arm-2-
  style CEM adversary.
- The governor here is a pure `v̂`-threshold. SWARM governors fold
  reputation, transfers, externality costs. Those don't change the
  geometric story (saturation is independent of payoffs) but they
  do change which θ the system equilibrates at.
- Saturation's wrong behavior at θ < 0 (AUROC < 0.5) is mild
  (0.469–0.503, basically chance) but real. Diagnose: under
  governors that reject almost nothing, σ_p of the accepted slice
  ≈ σ_p of the population, and the saturation ratio doesn't move
  much with f. Not a bug — a regime boundary worth knowing.
