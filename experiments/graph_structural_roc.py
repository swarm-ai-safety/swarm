"""ROC benchmark: graph-structural detector vs threshold detectors.

Implements the comparison protocol pre-registered in
docs/research/graph-structural-prereg.md (issue distributional-agi-safety-sk95).

Synthetic graph families (planted-coalition ground truth):

  benign            negative control
  collusion_ring    mutual-clique coalition embedded in sparse noise
  sybil_cluster     k agents with near-identical counterparty profile
  threshold_dancing k agents whose pair frequency sits just below
                    CollusionDetector's flag threshold

Each is scored by four detectors via per-node anomaly score in [0, 1]:

  graph_structural  detect_structural_anomalies (this module's subject)
  identity_jaccard  identity.detect_sybil_clusters (Jaccard + cosine)
  reputation_mutual reputation_governor.detect_collusion_clusters (mutual trust)
  collusion_score   metrics.collusion.CollusionDetector.analyze

Per-family per-detector ROC AUC is reported with bootstrap 95% CI.

Run:
    python -m experiments.graph_structural_roc --replicates 20 --output runs/
