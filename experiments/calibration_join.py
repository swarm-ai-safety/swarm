"""Calibration arm D — write the frozen joined CSV downstream studies join against.

Pre-registration: docs/research/calibration-prereg.md arm D.

Runs the full calibration pipeline in one process so interaction IDs
match by construction:

  1. Generate the scenario at the given seed.
  2. Run ProxyComputer on every accepted interaction → ProxyRow.
  3. Run each requested judge on a JudgeView of the same interaction.
  4. Left-join the per-judge scores with the proxy rows.
  5. Write `joined.csv` + `config.json` with the schema version.

Inline judging is the load-bearing design choice: re-loading interactions
from a separate arm B run would re-generate UUIDs (the fixture
generators use `uuid.uuid4()` which is not seeded by `random.seed()`),
so cross-process ID joins silently produce empty rows. Doing both passes
in one process eliminates that hazard.

The schema version is part of the contract — any column rename or
reorder must bump `JOINED_SCHEMA_VERSION` and break consumers loudly.

Usage:
    python -m experiments.calibration_join \
        --scenario obfuscation \
        --seed 42 \
        --judges mock
